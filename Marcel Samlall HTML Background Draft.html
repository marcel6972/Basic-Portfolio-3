	<p class="ectionContent">Greetings, fellow UCF Computer Coding classmates, colleagues, and Administrative members. My name is Marcel Samlall, and I am eager to learn more about the field of Computer Coding. For the past twenty years, I have benefited from working at various levels in the educational field ranging from elementary, middle school, secondary, and adult education levels.</p>

	<h1 class="sectionHeader">Background</h1>
	<p class="ectionContent">During the past decade, I served as an Academic Teacher for the Florida Department of Corrections. I instructed inmates, ranging in age from seventeen to twenty one, with learning disabilities assigned to the Work Release Centers of the Florida Department of Corrections. Presently, I work as a Special Education teacher at  P.M. Wells Charter Academy in Kissimmee.My educational background and time spent working with and helping students and young people, of diverse interests and backgrounds, will provide me a solid foundation to learn and to be involved in work related to Computer Coding and perhaps applying that knowledge in the Education field.In addition, I am certified to teach three different subject areas: 1) English and 2) Social Science (Grades 6-12) and 3)Exceptional Student Education (Grades K-12). I have my Bachelors of Arts degree in History, my Master of Arts degree in English, and also I have earned a M.B.A. Degree. I am originally from New Jersey, and I have been residing and working in the Orlando, Florida area for the past nineteen years.</p>

	<h1 class="sectionHeader">Interests</h1>
	<p class="ectionContent">During my free time, I enjoy traveling, reading, walking and exercising, and playing tennis weekly. I also enjoy the opportunity listening to live music and my favorite genres of music include Jazz and Rock. When I have the time, I truly relish the opportunity to unwind by watching sports on television especially watching MLB and New York Yankeesâ€™ games. I look forward to learning more about this intriguing field of Computer Coding and overcoming any potential challenges in the pursuit of this knowledge. Thank you for your time.</p>
